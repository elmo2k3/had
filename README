By now this project is very specialised for me and my hardware. By time
I will document and publish everything. If you have any questions
don't hesitate to contact me.

Functions:

	- communication with base station (atmega8, io ports, rf module) using serial port
	- handling devices connected to base station using rf (temperature module, remote control)
	- inserting temperatures into a mysql database
	- network server
	- controlling mpd using libmpd
	- submitting tracks from mpd to lastfm
	- controlling 64x16 led matrix connected over ethernet
	- sending sms on special events
	- communication with Honeywell HR20 thermometer (see http://openhr20.sourceforge.net)

The following files are taken from mpd (www.musicpd.org) and were more or less modified by me:
